# "Truecolor" GOES satellite imagery

This is a fun project around using machine learning generating 24-hour cloud
imagery from [GOES-16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GOES-16) satellite images.
The data is all publicly available on the cloud.  We cover the following topics.

* Accessing GOES weather satellite images.
* Training a machine learning model to estimate cloud cover from IR channels.
* Creating composite images from the estimated cloud cover.
* Running a beam pipeline to generate a set of cloud images.
* Setting up a free web server to view the results.
